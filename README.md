This app allows users to search for weather information for any city globally. Built with React on the frontend, the app provides a clean, user-friendly interface for checking current weather conditions like temperature, humidity, and weather description.

Key Features

Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive and works seamlessly across different devices such as desktops, tablets, and mobiles.

Units: Weather data is displayed in Celsius by default, but the app can be easily modified to show in Fahrenheit if required.

Simple and Clean Interface: The app offers a user-friendly interface with an attractive design to enhance the user experience.

Error Handling: If a city is not found or there’s an issue with the API request, an error message is displayed to the user.

Tech Stack
